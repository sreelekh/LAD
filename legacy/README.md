Top 5 anomalous counties identified by the proposed LAD algorithm based on the daily multivariate time-series, consisting ofcumulative COVID-19 per-capita infections and deaths. At any time-instance, the algorithm analyzes the bi-variate time series for all thecounties to identify anomalies. The time-series for the non-anomalous counties are plotted (light-gray) in the background for reference. For the counties in North Dakota (Burleigh and Grand Forks), the number of confirmed cases (top), and the sharp rise in November 2020, is theprimary cause for anomaly. On the other hand, Wayne County in Michigan was identified as anomalous primarily because of its abnormallyhigh death rate, especially when compared to the relatively moderate confirmed infection rate.
